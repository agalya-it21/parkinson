Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of Parkinson's disease can help in timely medical intervention and improve patient outcomes. 
Machine learning algorithms have shown promising results in predicting Parkinson's disease using various biomarkers.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts Parkinson's disease using patient data. The data used for this project includes various biomarkers such as name, different vocal frequencies at different 
situations, smoking history, and family history of Parkinson's disease.

The model is developed using a supervised learning approach, where the model is trained on a labeled dataset to predict the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease. The performance of the
model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from various public repositories and is preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to 
evaluate the performance of the model.

The machine learning model is developed using various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines. The hyperparameters of the model are tuned using grid search or
random search techniques to improve its performance.

The results of the model are presented in the form of a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score. The model can be deployed as a web application or integrated into existing healthcare systems to
assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing Parkinson's disease.

The code and documentation for this project are available on GitHub, which includes instructions on how to run the model and reproduce the results. The project is licensed under an open-source license, and 
contributions are welcome from the community.
